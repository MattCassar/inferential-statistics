    "* Example of cat diets\n",
    "    * Why can't we just take $\n",
    "    \\mu_{\\text{raw}} - \\mu_{\\text{canned}}$ and determine whether there's an impact?\n",

    "            * Could divide by variance to normalize\n",
    "        * Could use Bayesian approach to use distributions and compute probabilities\n",
    "    * Instead of arbitrarily guessing, formulate a null hypothesis and then show that this is unlikely to be true, at least below a certain probability (p-value)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.02 P-Values\n",
    "* Continuation of previous example using cat foot\n",
    "* Our null hypothesis is that there's no significant difference between the two diets\n",
    "    * $H_0: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0$\n",
    "* Also need to specify an alternative hypothesis\n",
    "    * We want to look at the area under the curve that represents a result that is at least as extreme as our null hypothesis\n",

    "            * take area to the left\n",
    "    * Use $\\alpha$ to denote significance level (typical choice is $\\alpha = 0.05$)\n",
    "* Note: we never accept the null hypothesis, we just fail to reject it\n",
    "* Before statistical software it was really painful to compute p-values. People used to use tables (e.g. z-tables) to do the calculations. It's much easier now with stiatistical software.\n",

    "### 1.03 Confidence intervals and two-sided tests\n",
    "* *Confidence interval* (definition): if you were to repeatedly draw samples and calculate the statistic, then what is the range of values around the statistic if I want the population parameter to lie within the interval in 95% of my samples?\n",
    "* Two sided tests and confidence are closely related\n",
    "* Test decision is made whether boundary values are exceeded\n",
    "* With a test the interval is centered around the expected test statistic value under the null\n",
    "* With a confidence interval, the interval is centered around the sample statistic value\n",
    "* The margins around these intervals are the same\n",
    "    * In a test, the margin equals the critical test statistic value ($T_{\\alpha / 2}$) expressed in standard errors\n",

    "### 1.04 Power\n",

    "            * More observations/larger population increase power\n",

    "                * Use one-sided tests rather than two-sided tests because they are stronger in terms of assumptions\n",
